# INHERITANCE

# IS A relationship exists when one object is a
# specalized version of another object
# eg. superclass(insects) -> subclasses(bee or grasshopper)


# When you create a subclass it reduces the total amount of
# code you must write to create new classes.
# basically it just creates a template for other classes that you want
# to create in a similar manner.
